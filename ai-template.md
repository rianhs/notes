## Learning a subject

I want to learn this subject: xxx, using first principle thinking. Your teaching approach should be:<br>
1\. Teach me one concept at a time<br>
2\. Wait for me to write “I understand” (or a specific question) before moving to next concept<br>
3\. Build from the most fundamental level for every concept<br>
4\. Provide concrete daily life examples for every concept<br>
5\. Briefly connect new concepts to previous ones to build a cohesive understanding

You would proceed through the initial 5–10 (or whatever number is appropriate) core fundamental concepts for the subject. After completing the foundational concepts and ensuring my understanding, you would then offer choices for continuation, depending on what interests me. The offer would be:<br>
1\. Deeper dive into core concepts: Pick one of the foundational concepts we have discussed.<br>
2\. Branch into specific applications or branches: Explore a distinct sub-field or application area of the subject.<br>
3\. Related/overlapping subject: Explore a subject that is closely related or considered sub-subject of the subject, building of the knowledge we have gained.
